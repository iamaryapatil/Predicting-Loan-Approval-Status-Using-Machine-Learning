# Predicting-Loan-Approval-Status-Using-Machine-Learning

####Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using a real-world dataset. The work was developed in two phases:

Phase 1 – Data Understanding & Exploration: Understanding the dataset, identifying trends, handling missing values, and preparing features.

Phase 2 – Machine Learning Modelling & Evaluation: Building, tuning, and evaluating multiple classification models to predict loan approval and generate actionable insights.

####Objectives
 -Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand applicant and loan characteristics.
- Clean, transform, and prepare data for predictive modelling.
- Build and compare multiple classification models to predict loan approval.
- Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics.
- Provide data-driven insights to improve loan approval decisions.

####Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analysed dataset structure, distributions, and summary statistics of applicant features.
- Visualised numerical and categorical variables (income, credit history, loan amount, property area).
- Identified correlations and patterns affecting loan approval.
- Detected imbalances in approved vs. rejected loans and explored feature importance.

####Data Preparation
- Handled missing values and outliers in applicant data.
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, marital status, education).
- Scaled numerical features for model stability.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets for model development.

####Machine Learning Modelling
##Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machine

##Regression Models
- Linear Regression (for predicting continuous loan amounts as an additional analysis)

####Model Evaluation
##Classification Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

##Regression Metrics
- MAE, MSE, RMSE
- R-squared Score

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, F1-Score, and interpretability.

####Outcomes
- Built end-to-end models to predict loan approval status.
- Visualised and analysed key applicant and loan features.
- Compared multiple algorithms, selected the optimal model for high predictive accuracy.
- Generated actionable insights for loan approval decision-making.
